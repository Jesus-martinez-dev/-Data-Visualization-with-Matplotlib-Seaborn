# ðŸ“Š Python Data Visualizations Practices

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to practice the fundamentals of data visualization. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to generate different types of charts (line, bar, scatter, etc.) using industry-standard libraries.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Visualization Libraries:**
* **Matplotlib:** Used for creating static and customizable charts.
* **Seaborn:** (If used) Used for more attractive statistical visualizations.
* **Pandas:** (If used) For data manipulation and preparation before visualization.

## âœ¨ Chart Features and Examples

The repository includes examples of the following visualization types (modify this list with what you actually have):

1. **Line Charts:** Show trends over time.
2. **Bar Charts:** Comparison of categories.
3. **Scatter Plots:** Correlation analysis between two variables.
4. **Histograms:** Distribution of a variable.This is just a python practice
